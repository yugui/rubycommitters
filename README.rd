= The List of Ruby Committers
The Ruby community is sometimes a bit too high-contextual. Who is "mput"? Who is "zenspider"? What does "why is why why" mean? What does it mean when ko1 says "the patch monster does ....".?

The list shows you who's who.

Many contributions made Ruby what now Ruby is. The honor of contribution for Ruby is not only the committers's. But it is sure that the committers are worth people to follow their activities. Follow them on twitter. Subscribe their blogs.
